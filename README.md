# HOW TO IMPLEMENT THE MATRIX EFFECT ON PC STARTUP:

---

Go to `C:\Windows\` in your File Explorer or press **Win + R** and type `%windir%`, then hit **Enter**

In this folder, create a new folder and title it `Scripts`

Inside this folder place the `.bat` files:  
`Entering the Matrix Startup.bat`, `Matrix One Tab.bat`, and `Matrix 7 Tabs.bat`

Copy the path address of this folder:  
`C:\Windows\Scripts`

---

Search **Edit Environment Variables** in Windows and open it

Go to the **Advanced** tab — you'll see **Environment Variables** at the bottom right

In the **User variables** box at the top, select **Path** and click **Edit**

Click **New** and paste the path address:  
`C:\Windows\Scripts`  

Then press **OK**

---

In your `C:\Windows\Scripts` folder, double-click `Matrix 7 Tabs` or `Matrix 1 Tab` to preview them  
Choose whichever you prefer and create a shortcut for it

Press **Win + R** and type `shell:startup`

Drag the shortcut you made into your **Startup** folder

That’s all! The Matrix Effect will now appear whenever you start up your PC

---

### NOTE:
The 7 tabs option might run slowly depending on your computer’s performance   
You can easily change the number of tabs, just right-click on the `Matrix 7 Tabs.bat` file and press **Edit**,  
Then change the number to whatever you prefer
